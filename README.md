# timeseries-project
A small project where I use the Household Electricity Consumption dataset from Kaggle and walk through the usual data cleaning and visualisations checking out trends, daily/weekly patterns, and any weird spikes in usage. After that, I try out a few forecasting models to see how well I can predict future consumption.
